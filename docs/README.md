# Toot Toot it's Time for CSS
But by the time you have a *decent* looking website you have 12 tabs open scratching your head on how to center something without flexboxes, well, the soloution is simple, USE FLEXBOXES. (and minui.css ðŸ˜˜)

## Usage
Add this line of code to your head to get the file served from GitHub;
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minin-prod/minui.css/master/minui.css">
```

If you want to download the CSS file and serve it from your webserver, [right click on this text and click "Save linked content as..."](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minin-prod/minui.css/master/minui.css) (I use opera so it may be different for you) then you can use this code to reference the file;
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="minui.css">
```

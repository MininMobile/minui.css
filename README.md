# minui.css
A simple, light-weight CSS framework.

More info on the [website](https://minin-prod.github.io/minui.css/)

## Usage
Add this line of code to your head to get the file served from GitHub;
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minin-prod/minui.css/master/minui.css">
```

If you want to download the CSS file and serve it from your webserver, [right click on this text and click "Save linked content as..."](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minin-prod/minui.css/master/minui.css) (I use opera so it may be different for you) then you can use this code to reference the file;
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="minui.css">
```
